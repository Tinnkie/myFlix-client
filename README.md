# myFlix React App

### Welcome to myFlix, a movie app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. This app allows movie enthusiasts to access information about different movies, create a profile to save their favorite movies, and interact with various features such as filtering, sorting, and viewing movie details.

## Objective

### The objective of this project is to build the client-side for myFlix app using React, based on its existing server-side code which includes a REST API and a database. The client-side will include several interface views that will handle data through the REST API endpoints, and provide a polished user experience.
